**Spending patterns across the years**
*  The **RTS total industries** category showed a prominent peak, especially in the later years, suggesting a significant increase in spending in this sector. The sharp rise towards the end of the timeline indicates a recovery or boom in this sector.
*  The **Services** category also showed a pronounced increase in the latter years, which reflects an expansion in the service sector or increased consumer spending in services.
Some categories, such as **Fuel** and **Hospitality**, showed dips at certain points, which could be indicative of market fluctuations, economic downturns, or changes in consumer behavior.

There's a noticeable shift in spending patterns in the most recent years, with some categories showing significant increases. This could be attributed to various factors including economic policy changes, market conditions, or societal shifts post-2020.
